After discussion with students and stakeholders in the decision, the school has decided to improvise and ammend its grading scales effective October 27th, 2022. The new grading scale is available on our [school profile](https://files.stjohn.edu.et/counselor/St%20John%20School%20Profile.pdf).

As part of the decision, the school has decided to add Honors for students who achieved a certain GPA.

In honor of St John Baptist De La Salle, we have **La Salle's List** in which students will be added if their Cumulative GPA is above 3.3. Other honors include:

* Distinction: For students whose Cumulative GPA is above 3.5
* Great Distinction: For students whose Cumulative GPA is above 3.65
* Very Great Distinction: For students whose Cumulative GPA is above 3.80
